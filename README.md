# Installing the Game
If you just want to play the latest version of the game you can get it from our [website](https://cortex-command-community.github.io/downloads).

# Getting Mods
You can get mods from our [mod portal](https://cccp.mod.io).

# Windows Build Instructions
First you need to download the necessary files:

1. Install the necessary tools.  
You'll probably want [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (build supports both 2017 and 2019 versions).  
You also need to have both x86 and x64 versions of the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) installed in order to run the compiled builds.  
You may also want to check out the list of recommended Visual Studio plugins [here](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source/wiki/Information,-Recommended-Plugins-and-Useful-Links).

2. Clone this Source Repository and the [Data Repository](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Data) in neighboring folders.  
**Do Not** change the folder names unless you want to make trouble for yourself.

3. Copy the following libraries from `Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source\external\lib\` into the **Data Repository**:
* `lua51.dll`
* `lua51-64.dll`
* `fmod.dll`
* `fmodL.dll`

Now you're ready to build and launch the game.  
Simply open `RTEA.sln` with Visual Studio, choose your target platform (x86 or x64) and configuration, and run the project.

* Use `Debug Full` for debugging with all visual elements enabled (builds fast, runs very slow).
* Use `Debug Minimal` for debugging with all visual elements disabled (builds fast, runs slightly faster).
* Use `Debug Release` for a debugger-enabled release build (builds slow, runs almost as fast as Final).
* Use `Final` to build release executable.

The first build will take a while, but future ones should be quicker.

If you want to use an IDE other than Visual Studio, you will have to build using meson. Check the [Linux](#building) and [Installing Dependencies](#installing-dependencies) section for pointers.

***

# Linux and macOS Build Instructions
The Linux build uses the meson build system, and builds against system libraries.

## Dependencies

* `g++>=8.1` or `clang++` (needs to support c++17 filesystem)
* `allegro4` (optional, if missing will attempt to compile a stripped down version)
* `loadpng` (optional, will be compiled if missing)
* `sdl2`
* `flac`
* `luajit`
* `lua`
* `minizip`
* `lz4>=1.9.0`
* `libpng`
* [`meson`](https://www.mesonbuild.com)`>= 0.60` (`pip install meson` if your distro doesn't include a recent version)
* `boost>=1.55`

## Building

1. Install Dependencies (see [below](#installing-dependencies) for instructions).

2. Clone this Source Repository and the [Data Respository](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Data).

3. Open a terminal in the Source Repository.

4. `meson build` or `meson --buildtype=debug build` for debug build (default is release build)

5. `ninja -C build`

6. (optional) `sudo ninja install -C build` (To uninstall later, keep the build directory intact. The game can then be uninstalled by `sudo ninja uninstall -C build`)

If you want to change the buildtype afterwards, you can use `meson configure --buildtype {release or debug}` in the build directory or create a secondary build directory as in Step 4. There are also additional build options documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source/wiki/Meson-build-options) as well as through running `meson configure` in the build directory.

## Running
(If you installed the game in step 6 above, it should appear with your regular applications and will just run)

1. Copy (or link, might be preferable for testing builds) `build/CortexCommand` or `build/CortexCommand_debug` (depending on if you made a debug build) into the **Data Repository**.

   `cd $DATA_REPOSITORY; ln -s ../Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source/build/CortexCommand . `

2. Copy all `libfmod` files from `external/lib/linux/x86_64` into the **Data Repository**.

   `cd $DATA_REPOSITORY; ln -s ../Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source/external/lib/linux/x86_64/libfmod.so* .`

4. Run `./CortexCommand` or `./CortexCommand_debug` in the **Data Repository**.

## Installing Dependencies

**macOS additional dependencies:**  
- `brew` [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) (or any other package manager)  
- `Xcode` or `Command Line Tools for Xcode` (if you need to, you can also generate an xcode project from meson using the `--backend=xcode` option on setup)

**Homebrew (macOS):**  
`brew install pkg-config sdl2 minizip lz4 flac luajit lua@5.1 libpng ninja meson`

**Arch Linux:**  
`sudo pacman -S allegro4 sdl2 boost flac luajit lua52 minizip lz4 libpng meson ninja base-devel`  

**Ubuntu >=20.04:**  
`sudo apt-get install build-essential liballegro4-dev libsdl2-dev libloadpng4-dev libflac++-dev luajit-5.1-dev liblua5.2-dev libminizip-dev liblz4-dev libpng++-dev ninja-build python-pip`  
`sudo python -m pip install meson`

**Fedora:**  
`# dnf install allegro-loadpng-devel allegro-devel lua-devel flac-devel luajit-devel minizip-compat-devel lz4-devel libpng-devel lua-devel meson ninja-build gcc gcc-c++`  

## Troubleshooting

* older versions of `pipewire(-alsa)` and fmod don't work well together, so the game might [not close, have no sound or crash](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/1514). Workaround by `ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/pulseaudio`

***

**Windows 10 (64-bit) without Visual Studio**  
- [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)
- [Clang Toolset](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) (Grab the latest LLVM-...-win64.exe)
- [git](https://www.git-scm.org)
- [meson](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases) (documentation [here](https://www.mesonbuild.com))
- (optional) Visual Studio for the Developer Consoles since setup otherwise may be unnecessarily hard
